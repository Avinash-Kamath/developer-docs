Scalekit enables apps to easily let users sign in using Github as their social connector. This guide walks you through
the process of setting up the connection between Scalekit and Github, and using the Scalekit SDK to add "Sign in with
Github" to your application.

By the end of this guide, you will be able to:

1. Set up an OAuth 2.0 connection between Scalekit and Github
2. Scalekit SDK to add "Sign in with Github" to your application

## Connect Github with Scalekit

**Navigate to Social Login settings**

Open your Scalekit dashboard and navigate to Social Login under the Authentication section.

## Configure OAuth settings

The OAuth Configuration details page helps you set up the connection:

- Note the **Redirect URI** provided for your app. You'll use this URL to register with Github.
- **Client ID** and **Client Secret** are generated by Github when you register an OAuth App. They enable Scalekit to
  authenticate your app and establish trust with Github.

**Set up Github OAuth 2.0**

Github lets you set up OAuth through the Mircosoft Identity Platform.
[Follow Github's instructions to set up OAuth 2.0](https://dub.sh/auth-oauth-app-docs).

- Use the Redirect URI from Scalekit as the Redirect URI in Github's setup
- Copy the generated Client ID and Client Secret into the Scalekit Dashboard

After completing the setup, click "Save Changes" in Scalekit for the changes to take effect.

## Test the Connection

Click the "Test Connection" button in Scalekit. You will be redirected to the Github Consent screen to authorize access.
A summary table will show the information that will be sent to your app.
