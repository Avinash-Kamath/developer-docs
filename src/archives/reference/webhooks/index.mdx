Webhooks allow your application to receive real-time notifications about events that occur in your Scalekit account. This section provides detailed information about webhook events, payloads, and how to implement webhook handlers in your application.

<Steps>
  1. [Register a webhook](/guides/product/registering-webhooks/)
  2. Handle webhook events in your application
  3. [Webhook Event Object](/reference/webhooks/event-object/)
</Steps>


## Event Types

Scalekit webhooks send notifications for various event types. Each event includes relevant data in its payload.

## Security

When implementing webhooks, it's crucial to verify that requests are coming from Scalekit. Our SDKs provide methods to verify webhook signatures. See our [implementation guide](/guides/extended/webhook-best-practices/) to implement [webhook verification](/guides/extended/webhook-best-practices/#1-verify-webhook-signatures) in your application.
