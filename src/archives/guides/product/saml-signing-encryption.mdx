Enterprise customers often require SAML-based authentication to let their employees sign in to your application using their company's identity provider (IdP). This guide explains how to strengthen your SAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO) connections through request signing and response encryption.

## Understanding SAML Trust

SAML 2.0 establishes trust between your application's authentication service and the Identity Provider (IdP) through the following process:

1. Create an application in the IdP
2. Configure your application's Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL and Entity ID in the IdP (found in your Scalekit dashboard)

Since SAML 2.0 authentication happens in the browser, the communication between your application and the IdP is susceptible to manipulation. Request signing and response encryption help secure this communication.

## Prerequisites

- You have an existing SAML-based SSO connection
- You enabled [admin portal](/manual/fundamentals/admin-portal/) for your customers

This configuration is typically performed by your customers' IT team.

## Request Signing

SAML requests travel over HTTP, making them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Request signing helps mitigate this risk by:

1. Your application signs the SAML request using its private key
2. The IdP validates the signature using your application's public key
3. The IdP proceeds with authentication only if the signature is valid

### Benefits

- Ensures request integrity
- Prevents modification by malicious browser plugins or man-in-the-middle attacks
- Validates that requests originate from your legitimate application

### Setup Process

1. Enable the admin portal for your customers
2. Your customers download the certificates from the admin portal
3. Your customers upload the certificates to the identity provider

This automatically enables request signing when Scalekit and your customers' IdP are connected.

## Response Encryption

Response encryption ensures that only your application can read the SAML assertions containing user information.

### How it Works

1. The IdP encrypts SAML assertions using your application's public key
2. The encrypted assertions are included in the SAML response
3. Your application decrypts the assertions using its private key to access user information

### Benefits

- Ensures only your application can read user information
- Makes stolen SAML responses useless without the private key
- Particularly important for financial institutions and banks

### Considerations

- Certificate rotation for expired certificates requires operational maintenance
- Additional processing overhead for encryption/decryption

### Setup Process

1. Enable the admin portal for your customers
2. Your customers download the certificates from the admin portal
3. Your customers upload the certificates to the identity provider

This automatically enables response encryption when Scalekit and your customers' IdP are connected.

## Single Logout (SLO) Request Signing

Similar to authentication requests, SLO requests can also be signed to ensure their integrity. The process follows the same principles as request signing:

1. Your application signs the SLO request using its private key
2. The IdP validates the signature using your application's public key
3. The IdP processes the logout request only if the signature is valid
