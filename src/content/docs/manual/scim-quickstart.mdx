Enterprises need to automatically provision and de-provision employee access to applications to
ensure security. Scalekit simplifies this process by providing a single interface to your app,
abstracting the complexities of various directory providers.

With [SCIM Provisioning](/scim/basics) from Scalekit, you can:

- Use **Webhooks** to listen for events from your customers' directory providers (e.g., user
  updates, group changes)
- Use **REST APIs** to list users, groups, and directories on demand

Scalekit enables you to sync user accounts with the latest data in the directory provider. This
allows you to:

- Create accounts for new hires during onboarding
- Deactivate accounts when employees depart
- Adjust access levels as employees change roles

## User Provisioning with Scalekit's Directory API

Scalekit's Directory API allows you to fetch information about users, groups, and directories
associated with an organization on-demand. This is useful for scenarios like running cron jobs to
sync user and group data. In this guide, we'll demonstrate how to use the List Users in a Directory
API to retrieve a list of users in a specific directory.

Before you begin, ensure that your organization has a directory set up in Scalekit.

Before diving in, ensure you have:

1. A Scalekit account
2. An organization with a configured directory
3. Access to the Scalekit Dashboard

#### Setting Up the SDK

Scalekit offers language-specific SDKs for fast SSO integration. Use the installation instructions
below for your technology stack:

<InstallSDK />

Navigate to the API Config tab in the Scalekit Dashboard to obtain your credentials. Store your
credentials securely in a `.env` file:

```sh showLineNumbers=false
SCALEKIT_ENVIRONMENT_URL='https://b2b-app-dev.scalekit.com'
SCALEKIT_CLIENT_ID='<CLIENT_ID_FROM_SCALEKIT_DASHBOARD>'
SCALEKIT_CLIENT_SECRET='<SECRET_FROM_SCALEKIT_DASHBOARD>'
```

Initialize the SDK with your API credentials and make your first API call to list organizations.
