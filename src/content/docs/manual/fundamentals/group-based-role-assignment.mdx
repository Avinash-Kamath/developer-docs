Scalekit allows you to automate user role assignment in your application by synchronizing with directory group memberships. This guide explains how to implement this feature, which eliminates the need for manual role management and ensures user access stays current with directory provider changes.

### What this guide covers

- Setting up roles in the Scalekit Dashboard
- Implementing webhook handlers to process directory events
- Managing default roles and role assignments

### What you'll need

- A Scalekit account with SCIM provisioning enabled. Typically, [done by your customer's administrator](/integrations/scim-integrations/okta-scim/#user-and-group-assignment).
- A webhook endpoint in your application to receive directory events
- Basic understanding of your directory provider's group structure

## How group-based role assignment works

Manually assigning roles to users in your application (viewer, member, editor, admin, etc.) can be time-consuming for administrators, particularly in large enterprises where access needs frequently change. Scalekit streamlines this process by establishing automated workflows that update your app about user role assignments based on directory group memberships.

A common strategy for managing varying access levels is to group users based on their specific access requirements. For example, if you're developing an application similar to GitHub with roles like maintainer, writer, and viewer, customer administrators can create user groups for each role within their directory provider.

When administrators create groups or add users to them, Scalekit notifies your application, enabling you to take necessary actions such as creating or modifying user roles. Regardless of the directory provider your customers use, Scalekit delivers normalized information, eliminating the need for data transformation across different providers.

## Setting up role mappings in Scalekit

Follow these steps to enable administrators to map directory groups to roles in your app:

<Steps>
  1. Go to the Scalekit Dashboard
  2. Select "SCIM Provisioning"
  3. Switch to the "Role Assignment" tab
  4. Create your app's roles
</Steps>

### Managing the default role

The first role you create in your app becomes the default role automatically. This means users who don't belong to any specific group will be assigned this role upon account creation.

To change the default role:
1. Navigate to the role settings
2. Click the "..." menu next to the desired role
3. Select "Edit"
4. Toggle the "Set as default role" option

## Implementing webhook handlers for role events

Scalekit continuously monitors updates from your customers' directory providers and sends event payloads to your application via a registered webhook endpoint. To set up these endpoints and manage subscriptions, refer to the [Scalekit Dashboard documentation](/reference/webhooks/overview).

### Processing user role updates

In this implementation, you'll listen for the `organization.directory.user_updated` event to determine a user's role from the payload. Scalekit automatically includes a role property relevant to your app, based on the role information configured in the Scalekit Dashboard.

## Summary

By implementing Scalekit's group-based role assignment feature, you can:

- Simplify access management for your enterprise customers
- Ensure user roles remain synchronized with their directory provider
- Reduce administrative overhead of manual role assignments
- Provide consistent role mapping across different directory providers
