> Empower your customers to configure and manage Single Sign-On settings independently

The Admin Portal simplifies the process of connecting your application to the identity or directory providers used by enterprise organizations.

By offering a self-service portal for your customers, you can minimize the need for extensive back-and-forth communication. Scalekit hosts and manages the Admin Portal entirely, providing two flexible integration options â€” No-Code and Embedded portals

## No-Code Admin Portal

A portal will show up for your customers to configure SSO settings by accessing a shareable link. This portal contains the configuration settings that lets your customers setup a connection to their identity provider.

To create and share a link for the Admin Portal, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [Scalekit Dashboard](https://app.scalekit.com).
2. Navigate to the "Organizations" tab.
3. Select the organization you want to provide access to.
4. Click "Generate Link" to create a new, shareable Admin Portal link.

```sh title="Example" wrap showLineNumbers=false
https://your-app.scalekit.dev/magicLink/2cbe56de-eec4-41d2-abed-90a5b82286c4_p
```

The link expires in 7 days but can be revoked at any time from the dashboard for security purposes.You can share the link through communication channels such as email, Slack, or other preferred methods.

<Aside>
Be cautious when sharing the link, as anyone with access to it can view and update the organization's connection settings

## Embedded Admin Portal

Users can do the connection setup right from your application by rendering Scalekit-hosted admin portal as a inline frame (iframe). This approach allows easy discovery & convenient access to the portal without the need for external links or separate portals.

Generate the embeddable portal link when page loads or refreshes and inject the `src` of the `<iframe>`, at your app's runtime. This ensure secure programmatic access.

<InstallSDK />

Use the **Generate Portal Link API** to create a unique, embeddable Admin Portal link specific to an organization.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```js {4}
generatePortalLink("<organization_id>");

async function generatePortalLink(orgID) {
  const link = await scalekit.organization.generatePortalLink(orgID);
  console.log(JSON.stringify(link, null, 2));
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python {1-3}
link = sc.organization.generate_portal_link(
  organization_id
)

print(link)
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
link, err := sc.Organization.GeneratePortalLink(
  ctx,
  organizationId
)
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java wrap
Link portalLink = client
  .organizations()
  .generatePortalLink(organizationId, Arrays.asList(Feature.sso, Feature.dir_sync));
```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

The API will return a JSON object containing the `location` property, which
is the URL to the Admin Portal.

```json wrap showLineNumbers=false
{
  "id": "8930509d-68cf-4e2c-8c6d-94d2b5e2db43",
  "location": "https://random-subdomain.scalekit.dev/magicLink/8930509d-68cf-4e2c-8c6d-94d2b5e2db43",
  "expireTime": "2024-10-03T13:35:50.563013Z"
}
```

Access the `location` property and set it as the `src` attribute of an iframe in your web pages at runtime. Ensure your domain is listed as one of the Redirect URIs in the **Scalekit Dashboard > API Config**.


```html {4} title="Render admin portal in iframe (example)" wrap showLineNumbers=false
<body>
  <h1>Admin Portal (Embed)</h1>
  <iframe
    src="https://random-subdomain.scalekit.dev/magicLink/8930509d-68cf-4e2c-8c6d-94d2b5e2db43"
    width="100%"
    height="600px"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="clipboard-write"
  >
  </iframe>
</body>
```

For example, if your application has a "Settings" page for your users, this page can allow them to configure connection with their IdP right within from your app.



<Aside type="caution">

1. The programmatically generated link is designed for one-time use and expires after 1 minute. Once activated in iframe, the IT admin can configure SSO for an extended period. The session remains active
   until the setup is complete.
2. The embedded portal session times out after 6 hours, requiring administrators to complete the
   configuration within this period.

</Aside>

The Admin Portal can be customized to match your brand's logo and colors. Refer to the
[Customize Admin Portal Guide](https://example.com) for more information.
