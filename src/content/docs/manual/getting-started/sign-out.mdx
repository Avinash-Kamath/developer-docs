This guide explains how to implement a secure sign-out process in your application using Scalekit. You'll learn how to properly end user sessions and redirect users after they sign out.

### Prerequisites

Before implementing the sign-out flow, you should:
- Have a working Scalekit authentication system in your application
- Understand [how Scalekit manages user sessions](/manual/getting-started/manage-user-sessions#implementing-session-management)
- Be familiar with your application's redirect URIs configuration

## Understanding the sign-out process

When a user signs out, your application must communicate with the Scalekit environment to properly terminate the session. This two-part process ensures security by:
1. Ending the session in the Scalekit environment
2. Removing session cookies from the user's browser

## Sign out flow

<Steps>

1. User clicks the sign out button
2. Your application redirects to your Scalekit environment's sign out endpoint.
3. Scalekit ends the session in your Scalekit environment
4. Scalekit redirects the user back to your application
5. Your application removes the cookies from the user's browser that were used to create and maintain the session

</Steps>

## Implementing sign-out in your application

The sign-out implementation requires you to redirect users to your Scalekit environment's sign-out endpoint.

### Building the sign-out endpoint URL

The sign out endpoint is the browser URL that your application should redirect to when a user clicks the sign out button.

```http wrap "/end_session" "<postLogoutRedirectUri>" "<idToken>"
https://<your-subdomain>.scalekit.dev/end_session?id_token_hint=<idToken>&post_logout_redirect_uri=<postLogoutRedirectUri>
```

[See the reference for the `/end_session` endpoint](/reference/concepts/auth-endpoints#the-end_session-endpoint)

### Providing the required parameters

You need to include two key parameters in your sign-out request:

1. **id_token_hint**: The `id_token` received during the [user's sign-in process](/manual/getting-started/authenticate-users#understanding-the-response). Scalekit uses this to identify which session to terminate.

2. **post_logout_redirect_uri**: The URL where users will be redirected after signing out. This URL must be whitelisted in your Scalekit environment configuration.

<Aside type='tip'>
You can whitelist redirect URIs in your Scalekit environment settings or programmatically via the API.
</Aside>

<Aside type='caution'>
The requirement to pass the `id_token_hint` will be made optional in the near future.
</Aside>

## Testing your sign-out implementation

After implementing the sign-out flow, test it by:
1. Signing in a user
2. Triggering the sign-out process
3. Verifying the user is properly redirected
4. Confirming the user cannot access protected resources without signing in again
