Scalekit provides robust user management capabilities that allow you to create and maintain user records and apply authentication policies tailored to your application or specific organizations.

**In this guide, you'll learn how to:**
- Create users during signup
- Retrieve user information
- Update user profiles
- Delete users

## User Management Overview

User management is a critical component of any application. With Scalekit, you can:

- Store user profiles securely
- Track user activity

## Creating Users

#### Option 1: Create a User During Sign Up

The [authentication flow](/manual/getting-started/authenticate-users#authentication-flow-overview) allows you to automatically create a user record during signup by adding the `prompt=create` parameter to the [authorization endpoint](/manual/getting-started/authenticate-users#generate-the-authorization-url).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Request Format">
```sh
https://<your-subdomain>.scalekit.dev/oauth/authorize
  ?response_type=code
  &client_id=skc_<your-unique-identifier>          # Replace with your client ID
  &redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/api/callback
  &scope=openid%20profile%20email      # URL-encoded space between scopes
  &prompt=create                       # Forces the user to sign up
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

See the complete [request format documentation](/reference/concepts/auth-endpoints#the-oauthauthorize-endpoint) for additional parameters.

#### Option 2: Create a User via API

You can programmatically create users using the User Management API.

```sh
curl 'https://$ENV_URL/api/v1/organizations/{organization_id}/users' \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "create_time": "",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "external_id": "ext_12345a67b89c",
  "id": "usr_1234abcd5678efgh",
  "identity": "auth0|1234567890abcdef",
  "last_login": "",
  "metadata": {
    "department": "engineering",
    "location": "nyc-office"
  },
  "phone_number": "+14155552671",
  "update_time": "",
  "user_profile": {
    "custom_attributes": {
      "department": "engineering",
      "security_clearance": "level2"
    },
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "locale": "en-US",
    "metadata": {
      "account_status": "active",
      "signup_source": "mobile_app"
    },
    "name": "John Michael Doe"
  }
}'
```

## Retrieving User Information

You can retrieve user information using the User ID.

```sh
curl 'https://$ENV_URL/api/v1/organizations/{organization_id}/users/{id}'
```

You can also list all users in your environment:

```sh
curl 'https://$ENV_URL/api/v1/organizations/{organization_id}/users'
```

## Updating User Profiles

Update a user's information like name, email, or custom metadata.

```sh
curl 'https://$ENV_URL/api/v1/organizations/{organization_id}/users/{id}' \
  --request PATCH \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "email": "new.email@example.com",
  "phone_number": "+14155552671"
}'
```

## Deleting Users

You can delete a user when they are no longer needed in your system.

```sh wrap
curl 'https://$ENV_URL/api/v1/organizations/{organization_id}/users/{id}' \
  --request DELETE
# Successful response returns empty response body
```

## Best Practices for User Management

When implementing user management with Scalekit, consider these best practices:

1. **Secure Access Control**: Always validate user permissions before allowing access to sensitive operations
2. **Custom Metadata**: Use the metadata field to store application-specific user attributes
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for API requests
4. **User Removal**: Archive users instead of permanently deleting them when appropriate
5. **Audit Logging**: Track important user management operations for security and compliance

<Aside type="caution">
Never expose your API access tokens in client-side code. Always make user management API calls from your backend services.
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting

Here are solutions to common issues you might encounter:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| User creation fails | Verify that the email is valid and not already in use |
| Cannot update user | Check that you have the proper permissions and are using a valid user ID |
| Authentication errors | Verify your access token is valid and has the required scopes |

<Aside type="tip">
For comprehensive API documentation, refer to the [User Management API Reference](https://docs.scalekit.dev/apis#tag/users). Native SDKs for managing users are coming soon to make integration even easier.
