Scalekit environment allows you to manage user records. Maintain user profiles, organization memberships and apply authentication policies for your application or specific to a organization user belongs to.

In this guide, you'll learn how to manage your users in your Scalekit environment.

## Create a user on sign up

[Authentication flow](manual/getting-started/authenticate-users#authentication-flow-overview) allows you to create a user record on sign up by passing the `prompt=create` parameter to the [authorization endpoint](/manual/getting-started/authenticate-users#generate-the-authorization-url).

```sh ins={6}
https://<your-environment-domain>.scalekit.cloud/oauth/authorize
  ?response_type=code
  &client_id=<your-client-id>          # Replace with your client ID
  &redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/api/callback
  &scope=openid%20profile%20email      # URL-encoded space between scopes
  &prompt=create                      # Optional, forces the user to sign up if they don't have an account
```
See the expected [request format to the authorization endpoint](/reference/concepts/auth-endpoints#the-oauthauthorize-endpoint)

This will create a user record in your Scalekit environment. You can then use the [user management API](/apis#tag/users) to manage the user record.
