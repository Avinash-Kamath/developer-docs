Sign in is how users access your application after verifying their identity. For B2B applications, sign in involves additional complexity as users may belong to multiple organizations and each organization may have different authentication requirements.

Here are some common sign in use cases:

- **Multiple authentication methods**: Users can choose different authentication methods to sign in, such as passwordless, their choice of social login, or enterprise SSO.
- **Organization-enforced policies**: Organization administrators can enforce sign in policies, such as requiring specific authentication method for certain users or authenticating users through their identity provider.
- **Cross-organization access**: A user can sign in to access multiple organizations or workspaces within your application.
- **Invitation-based access**: A user signs in for the first time after accepting an email invitation to join an organization.
- **Enterprise SSO integration**: Users authenticate through their corporate identity provider (e.g., Okta, Azure AD) instead of traditional username/password.

Scalekit helps you implement all such signup flows while handling the complexity of user management and authentication.

Let's get started!

<Steps>
 1. ## Install the Scalekit SDK

    <InstallSDKSection />

    Copy your API credentials from the Scalekit dashboard's API Config section and set them as environment variables.
    ```bash
    SCALEKIT_ENVIRONMENT_URL='<YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_URL>'
    SCALEKIT_CLIENT_ID='<ENVIRONMENT_CLIENT_ID>'
    SCALEKIT_CLIENT_SECRET='<ENVIRONMENT_CLIENT_SECRET>'
    ```

    Create a new Scalekit client instance.
    <EnvSection />

  2. ## Redirect to the login page
       Generate the authorization URL to redirect users to the Scalekit-hosted login page. To get a `refreshToken` for session management, ensure you include `offline_access` in the scopes.

      <RedirectAuthPageSection />

     This will redirect the user to Scalekit's hosted sign-in page.

3. ## Handle user authentication
      Users can now sign in using their preferred method. Scalekit handles the authentication details based on your configuration.

      <LinkCard
        title="Configure Authentication Methods"
        href="/fsa/guides/auth-methods/"
        description="Learn how to enable and customize passwordless, social, and enterprise SSO login options."
      />

4. ## Retrieve user profile
      After identity verification, Scalekit triggers a callback to your `redirect_uri` with an authorization code. Exchange this code to get the user's profile.

      <RetrieveUserDetailsSection />

      The `authResult` contains the user's profile and the necessary tokens to create a session.

4. ## Create a user session
      With the user's identity verified, you can now establish a session. This typically involves storing the tokens securely and using them to manage the user's authenticated state.

      <CreateSessionSection />

</Steps>

## What's next?

You have successfully implemented the login flow. Now you can:
- [Manage user sessions](/fsa/guides/manage-session/) to handle token refreshes and expirations.
- [Implement a secure logout flow](/fsa/guides/logout/).
- Explore the normalized [user profile schema](/fsa/reference/user-profile/).
