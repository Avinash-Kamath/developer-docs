Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning automatically creates user accounts when someone tries to sign in for the first time. Instead of requiring manual account creation or pre-registration, users can access your application immediately using their existing identity.

**JIT provisioning works across the web** - from enterprise applications where employees access company tools through their corporate identity, to consumer apps where users sign in with social accounts like Google or GitHub.

When a user attempts to sign in for the first time, Scalekit automatically:

1. **Creates a user account** based on their identity information
2. **Sets up their profile** with details from their identity provider
3. **Grants appropriate access** based on your application's rules

This happens seamlessly in the background, so users can start using your application immediately.

## JIT provisioning through authentication methods

Scalekit supports JIT provisioning through three main authentication methods:

**Social login and passwordless authentication**

When users sign in with social login (Google, GitHub, etc.) or passwordless authentication for the first time, Scalekit automatically creates their account and user profile.

**Example**: A user clicks "Sign in with Google" on your application. If they haven't used your app before, Scalekit creates their account automatically using their Google profile information.

**Single sign-on (SSO)**

Organizations can configure SSO for their users. When SSO is integrated with Scalekit and organization administrators have [verified their domains](/fsa/guides/merge-identities/#verify-organization-domains), Scalekit automatically creates user accounts.

Users access your application through their organization's SSO portal. Scalekit creates accounts automatically for verified domain users. Contractors using external email addresses must be [invited](/fsa/guides/invite-only-signup/) first.

Many organizations maintain catalogs of approved applications. When users access your app from their catalog for the first time, JIT provisioning happens automatically.

**SCIM provisioning** <Badge type="note" text="Coming soon" />

Organizations use [SCIM provisioning](/directory/scim/quickstart/) to sync user data from their identity provider. Scalekit automatically creates accounts for users provisioned through SCIM.

## Getting started

If your application is integrated with Scalekit, JIT provisioning is available by default. To integrate Scalekit with your application, see our [Quickstart guide](/fsa/quickstart/).
