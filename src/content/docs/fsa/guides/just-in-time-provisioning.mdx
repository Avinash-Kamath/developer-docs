When users attempt to sign in (usually via SSO) for the first time, their accounts can be created automatically without requiring pre-registration. This streamlines onboarding for enterprise customers.

**Scenario**: An employee at your customer's company tries to access your application through their company's SSO portal. Their account is created automatically based on their corporate identity.

JIT provisioning will be configurable through the Scalekit Dashboard, allowing you to control which users can be automatically provisioned based on their email domain or group memberships.
