B2B applications often require different levels of access for different users. Roles are a powerful way to manage these permissions and ensure that users can only access the features and data appropriate for them.

For example, you might have roles like:
- **Admin**: Can access all features, including billing and user management.
- **Editor**: Can create and edit content, but cannot manage users or settings.
- **Viewer**: Can only view content, but cannot make any changes.

Scalekit provides a flexible role-based access control (RBAC) system that allows you to define custom roles and assign them to users, helping you build a secure and scalable application.

## How roles work

By default, Scalekit provides two roles: `admin` and `member`. When the first user signs up and creates an organization, they are automatically assigned the `admin` role. Any subsequent users who join the organization are assigned the `member` role by default.

## Managing roles

You can manage roles, including creating custom ones, from the Scalekit dashboard:

1.  Navigate to **User Management** > **Roles**.
2.  You will see a list of existing roles. Click **+ Add Roles** to create a new role.
3.  For each new role, you can define a **Role Name**, **Key**, and **Description**. The **Key** is what you will receive in the token and use in your application to control access.

## Accessing user roles

Once a user is authenticated, their assigned roles are included in the `idToken` and `accessToken`. You can use this information in your application's backend to control access to different resources.

While the `roles` claim is an array, Scalekit currently supports a single role per user within an organization.

Here's an example of a decoded `idToken` containing the `roles` claim:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="ID Token (decoded)" value="idToken">
```json
{
  "at_hash": "ec_jU2ZKpFelCKLTRWiRsg",
  "aud": [
    "skc_58327482062864390"
  ],
  "azp": "skc_58327482062864390",
  "c_hash": "6wMreK9kWQQY6O5R0CiiYg",
  "client_id": "skc_58327482062864390",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "email_verified": true,
  "exp": 1742975822,
  "family_name": "Doe",
  "given_name": "John",
  "iat": 1742974022,
  "iss": "https://scalekit-z44iroqaaada-dev.scalekit.cloud",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "oid": "org_59615193906282635",
  "sid": "ses_65274187031249433",
  "sub": "usr_63261014140912135",
  "roles": [
    "admin"
  ]
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

With the role information readily available in the tokens, you can implement fine-grained access control in your application logic.
