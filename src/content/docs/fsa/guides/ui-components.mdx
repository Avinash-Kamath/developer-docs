Scalekit will provide ready-to-use UI components that you can embed in your application for common user management tasks:

**User List Component**: Display organization members with filtering, sorting, and pagination capabilities.

**User Profile Component**: Show and edit user profile information with validation and error handling.

**Invitation Component**: Allow organization admins to invite new users with customizable role selection.

These components will integrate directly with Scalekit's APIs while matching your application's design system through customizable themes and styling options.
