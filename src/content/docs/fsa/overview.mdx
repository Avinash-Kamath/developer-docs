## Authentication methods

There are several authentication methods your users may prefer to Sign into your application. With Scalekit, you can support the following methods:

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="Passwordless"
    href="/guides/fsa/social-logins/"
    description="Send verification codes or magic links to your users"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Enterprise SSO"
    href="/guides/fsa/enterprise-sso/"
    description="Let users sign in with their organization's identity provider"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Social Logins"
    href="/guides/fsa/social-logins/"
    description="Let users sign in with their social provider"
  />
</CardGrid>


All the Sign-in pages are managed by Scalekit. You can customize the look and feel of the pages to match your brand.
