## Integrate with Directories

Scalekit provides SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) integration with major directory providers, allowing you to automate user provisioning and deprovisioning. With SCIM, you can synchronize user accounts between your identity provider and your application, ensuring that user access is automatically managed when employees join, move within, or leave your organization.

Below you'll find guides for setting up SCIM with popular directory providers. Each guide provides detailed instructions for configuring your directory service and connecting it to Scalekit for seamless user management.
