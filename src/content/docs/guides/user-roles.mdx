User roles allow you to implement granular access control within your application. By assigning roles to users, you can determine what features or data they can access, creating a more secure and personalized experience.

## Managing roles

Scalekit provides two default roles: `admin` and `member`. You can extend this by adding custom roles tailored to your application's needs.

### From the dashboard

You can manage roles directly from the Scalekit dashboard:

1.  Navigate to **User Management** > **Roles**.
2.  Here you can see the list of existing roles. Click **+ Add Roles** to create a new one.
3.  You can define a **Role Name**, **Key**, and **Description** for each role.

### Default roles

You can configure default roles that are automatically assigned to users in different contexts:
- **Default role for creator**: The role assigned to the user who creates an organization.
- **Default role for members**: The role assigned to users when they join an organization.

## Accessing user roles


Once a user signs up or logs in, their assigned role is included in the `idToken` and access token that your application receives after the authorization code exchange, as seen in the [Quickstart](/fsa/quickstart/). While the `roles` claim is an array, Scalekit currently supports a single role per user.

Here's an example of a decoded `idToken` containing the `roles` claim:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="ID Token (decoded)" value="idToken">
```json
{
  "at_hash": "ec_jU2ZKpFelCKLTRWiRsg",
  "aud": [

  ],

  "roles": [

  ]
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside type="note">
  Role information will be available in the access token after exchanging the authorization code for tokens. This feature is currently a work in progress.

You can use this information in your application to control access to different modules or features.
