**Secure, standards-based API access for your B2B SaaS platform**

Scalekit API Authentication provides OAuth 2.1-based machine-to-machine (M2M) authentication that enables your B2B SaaS platform to securely provide API access to three key audiences: your tenant organizations, external developers, and your own microservices.

## The B2B SaaS API Challenge

B2B SaaS platforms face unique API authentication challenges that consumer apps don't encounter:

### Multi-Tenant Data Isolation

Your APIs must automatically scope data access to the correct organization, preventing data leaks between tenants while enabling powerful automation.

### Organizational vs. User Access

Organizations need system-level API access for automation and integrations, separate from individual user permissions.

### Developer Ecosystem Growth

Third-party developers want to build integrations for your platform, requiring secure user-delegated access with proper consent flows.

### Service-to-Service Security

Your microservices need high-performance, secure communication without compromising on zero-trust principles.

## How Scalekit API Authentication Works

Scalekit provides three distinct OAuth 2.1 authentication patterns, each optimized for different access scenarios:

![Different Access Scenarios](@/assets/docs/guides/m2m/overview.png)

### Pattern 1: Service Principals (Organization-Level Access)

Enable your tenant organizations to create automated systems that access your APIs on behalf of the entire organization.

**Use Cases:**

- Business intelligence tools pulling organizational data
- ERP system integrations and data synchronization  
- Compliance reporting and automated data exports
- Internal dashboards and monitoring systems

**Key Benefits:**

- ‚úÖ No user interaction required for automation
- ‚úÖ Automatic organization-level data scoping
- ‚úÖ Long-running system integrations
- ‚úÖ Admin-controlled credential management

### Pattern 2: Third-Party Apps (User-Delegated Access)

Allow external developers to build applications that access your APIs with explicit user consent.

**Use Cases:**

- Partner integrations (marketing tools, analytics)
- Mobile applications built by external developers
- Marketplace apps and plugin ecosystems
- Integration platforms (Zapier-style automations)

**Key Benefits:**

- ‚úÖ User consent and permission management
- ‚úÖ Revocable access with granular scopes
- ‚úÖ Developer ecosystem growth
- ‚úÖ User-scoped data access only

### Pattern 3: Microservices (Service-to-Service Authentication)

Secure communication between your own microservices with high-performance token validation.

**Use Cases:**

- API Gateway to backend services
- Service mesh communication (Istio, Linkerd)
- Event-driven architecture with secure messaging
- Zero-trust internal network security

**Key Benefits:**

- ‚úÖ High-throughput token validation (thousands/sec)
- ‚úÖ Short-lived, frequently rotated tokens
- ‚úÖ Service identity and access control
- ‚úÖ Internal security without user interaction

## OAuth 2.1 Flows by Pattern

Each authentication pattern uses the most appropriate OAuth 2.1 flow for its specific security and performance requirements:

| Pattern | OAuth Flow | Token Lifetime | Consent Required |
|---------|------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Service Principals** | Client Credentials | 1-24 hours | No (org admin creates) |
| **User Delegated Access** | Authorization Code + PKCE | 1 hour + refresh | Yes (user consent) |
| **Microservices** | Client Credentials | 5-15 minutes | No (service identity) |

### Security Features Across All Patterns

- üîê **JWT tokens** with RS256 signing for stateless validation
- üîê **Automatic data scoping** - tokens include organization/user context
- üîê **Granular permissions** via OAuth scopes
- üîê **Token introspection** and real-time validation
- üîê **Audit logging** for all authentication events

## Integration Architecture

Scalekit API Authentication integrates seamlessly into your existing B2B SaaS architecture:

![Integration Architecture](@/assets/docs/guides/m2m/workflow.png)

### Implementation Steps Overview

1. Choose Your Pattern - Identify which authentication scenarios your platform needs
2. Configure Scalekit - Set up OAuth clients and token validation
3. Build Admin UI - Enable organization admins to manage API access
4. Secure Your APIs - Implement token validation and data scoping
5. Monitor & Scale - Add usage analytics and security monitoring

---

## Token Validation Flow

All patterns use the same secure token validation approach in your APIs:

![Token Validation Flow](@/assets/docs/guides/m2m/token-creation-verification.png)

**Validation Benefits:**

- **Stateless** - No need to store tokens in your database
- **High Performance** - JWKS caching minimizes external calls
- **Automatic Scoping** - Tokens contain organization/user context
- **Real-time Revocation** - Optional token introspection for immediate revocation

---

## When to Use Each Pattern

### Start with Service Principals if

- Your customers are asking for API access for automation
- You want to enable BI tool integrations (Tableau, PowerBI)
- Organizations need to sync data with their ERP systems
- You're looking to create new API revenue streams

**üëâ [Service Principals Guide](/guides/m2m/service-principals)**

### Add Third-Party Apps when

- You want to build a developer ecosystem around your platform
- Partners want to create integrations for your users
- You need mobile app support from external developers
- You want marketplace-style app integrations

**üëâ [Third-Party Apps Guide](/guides/m2m/user-delegated-access)**

### Implement Microservices Auth for

- Securing internal API communication
- Service mesh authentication requirements
- Zero-trust network architecture
- High-performance service-to-service calls

**üëâ [Microservices Guide](/guides/m2m/microservices)**

## Real-World Success Stories

### Enterprise CRM Platform

*"We enabled BigCorp to connect their Tableau dashboards directly to our CRM APIs using Service Principals. They went from manual data exports to real-time executive dashboards in one week."*

**Implementation:** Service Principals ‚Üí 300% increase in API usage revenue

### Project Management SaaS

*"Our third-party developer ecosystem grew 10x after implementing OAuth for external apps. Partners can now build time-tracking apps that integrate seamlessly with user projects."*

**Implementation:** Third-Party Apps ‚Üí 50+ partner integrations launched

### E-commerce Platform

*"Moving from API keys to OAuth 2.1 for our microservices improved security and gave us per-service analytics. Our compliance team finally approved our SOC2 certification."*

**Implementation:** Microservices Auth ‚Üí SOC2 compliance achieved
