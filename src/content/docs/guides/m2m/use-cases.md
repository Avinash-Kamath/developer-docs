**Choose the right authentication pattern for your B2B SaaS platform**

As a B2B SaaS provider, you need to offer secure API access to different types of consumers. This guide helps you quickly identify which authentication pattern fits your specific needs.

## Quick Decision Guide

**Answer these questions to identify your primary use case:**

1. **Who needs to access your API?**
   - Your tenant organizations' internal systems â†’ **Service Principals**
   - External developers building apps for your platform â†’ **Third-Party Apps**  
   - Your own microservices communicating internally â†’ **Microservices**

2. **Do you need user consent in the flow?**
   - No, organizational or system-level access â†’ **Service Principals** or **Microservices**
   - Yes, users must grant permission to third-party apps â†’ **Third-Party Apps**

3. **Where will the integration run?**
   - Your customers' infrastructure â†’ **Service Principals**
   - External developers' applications â†’ **Third-Party Apps**
   - Your own infrastructure â†’ **Microservices**

## Use Case 1: Service Principals (Org-level Tokens)

**Your tenant organizations need automated access to your APIs for their internal systems.**

### When Your Customers Need Service Principals

- Business Intelligence & reporting tools
- ERP system integrations
- Compliance automation & data exports
- Internal dashboards & monitoring
- Backup & data archival systems

### Key Characteristics

- **Organization-level access** - tokens represent the entire tenant organization
- **No user consent required** - admins create credentials for organizational use
- **Data isolation** - automatic scoping to organization's data only
- **Long-running automation** - designed for persistent organizational systems

### Real-World Example

**Your Platform:** AcmeCRM  
**Customer:** BigCorp using AcmeCRM  
**Need:** BigCorp's Tableau integration pulls customer data daily for executive dashboards

BigCorp admin creates a Service Principal in AcmeCRM â†’ Gets `client_id`/`client_secret` â†’ Configures Tableau â†’ Tableau uses Client Credentials flow â†’ AcmeCRM returns only BigCorp's customer data

## Use Case 2: Third-Party Applications (User-delegated Access)

**External developers build applications that access your platform on behalf of your users.**

### When You Want Third-Party Developer Ecosystem

- Partner integrations (marketing tools, analytics)
- Mobile apps built by external developers
- Customer automation tools (Zapier-style)
- Marketplace apps & plugin ecosystems
- Integration platforms & custom solutions

### Key Characteristics

- **User consent required** - individual users explicitly grant permission
- **User-scoped access** - tokens tied to specific user accounts
- **External developers** - code runs outside your infrastructure
- **Revocable permissions** - users can revoke access anytime

### Real-World Example

**Your Platform:** EmailFlow  
**Third-Party:** AnalyticsPro  
**Need:** AnalyticsPro builds analytics dashboards for EmailFlow users

AnalyticsPro registers app â†’ User clicks "Connect EmailFlow" â†’ OAuth consent flow â†’ User grants permissions â†’ AnalyticsPro gets user-scoped access token â†’ Can analyze that user's campaigns only

## Use Case 3: Microservices (Service-to-Service)

**Your own microservices need to authenticate with each other securely.**

### When Your Platform Needs Internal Service Auth

- API Gateway to backend services
- Service mesh communication (Istio, Linkerd)
- Event-driven architecture with secure messaging
- Zero-trust network security
- Database access control per service

### Key Characteristics

- **High-throughput requirements** - thousands of requests per second
- **Short-lived tokens** - frequently rotated (5-15 minutes)
- **Internal network only** - communication within your infrastructure
- **Service identity** - each service has unique credentials

### Real-World Example

**Your Platform:** CommerceHub  
**Architecture:** API Gateway + User Service + Order Service + Payment Service  
**Need:** Gateway authenticates all calls to backend services

Each service gets credentials â†’ Gateway caches tokens â†’ Uses Bearer tokens for all internal API calls â†’ Services validate tokens via JWKS â†’ Zero-trust internal communication

## Implementation Strategy

Most B2B SaaS platforms implement multiple patterns as they evolve:

### **Recommended Progression:**

**Phase 1: Foundation** â†’ Start with **Microservices** to secure internal architecture

**Phase 2: Customer Value** â†’ Add **Service Principals** to enable customer automation and API revenue

**Phase 3: Platform Growth** â†’ Add **Third-Party Apps** to create ecosystem effects and partner integrations

### **Decision Matrix:**

| Factor | Service Principals | Third-Party Apps | Microservices |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Target Users** | Your customers | External developers | Your services |
| **User Consent** | Not required | Required | Not required |
| **Data Access** | Organization-scoped | User-scoped | Service-scoped |
| **Business Value** | Customer enablement | Platform ecosystem | Internal security |
| **Implementation Effort** | Medium | High | Low-Medium |
