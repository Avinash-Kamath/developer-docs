Scalekit by default uses our own email provider to send emails to your users to verify their email address via OTP or Magic Link. But, we also support letting you configure your own email provider so that all the emails that are sent to your users will come from your own branding and from address, thus improving deliverability and security.

To configure your own email provider, navigate to _Branding > Email Templates_ and click on _Custom Email Provider_.

On this page, you can configure your own email provider by providing the following information:

- **Sender Name**: The name that will be displayed as the sender of the email
- **Sender Email**: The email address that will be used as the sender of the email
- **Reply To Email**: The email address that will be used as the reply to email address
- **Email Provider**: The email provider that you want to use to send the emails
- **Email Provider API Key**: The API key that is required to use the email provider

Once you have configured your own email provider, all the emails that are sent to your users will come from your own branding and from address, thus improving deliverability and security.
