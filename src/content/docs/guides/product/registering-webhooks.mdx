Webhooks allow your application to receive real-time notifications when specific events occur in Scalekit. By registering webhooks, you can build integrations that immediately react to events such as user creations, organization updates, and authentication events.

This guide walks you through the process of registering webhooks in Scalekit.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Access to the Scalekit dashboard
- Administrative permissions for the environment where you want to register webhooks
- An endpoint URL that can receive webhook payloads
