Scalekit now provides an IdP Simulator  to simplify the process of testing Single Sign-On (SSO) implementations during the development phase. This eliminates the need for developers to configure multiple Identity Providers (IdPs) while building their apps, saving valuable time and effort.

Developers can avoid the hassle of setting up a Test-like Organization, which requires intricate SAML configuration, Attribute Mapping, and Assigning a User or Group. This tedious process is unnecessary when the goal is simply to verify that their code functions correctly and retrieves user profile details to enable user sign-in to their app.
