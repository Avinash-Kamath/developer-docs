Organizations in Scalekit represent your application's customers. Scalekit provides a default test organization to help developers test SSO and Social connections without needing to set up real customer environments.

## Accessing the Test Organization

To view a test organization:
1. Navigate to the Organizations section in your Scalekit dashboard
2. Click on "Test Organization" from the list of organizations

## Pre-configured Identity Provider

Test organizations come with a pre-configured Identity Provider (IdP) called "IdP Simulator." This simulates what your real customers would have with providers like Okta, Azure, or Google.

The IdP Simulator:
- Is OpenID Connect (OIDC) compliant
- Has its own [organization ID for programmatic API calls](/manual/sso-quickstart/#by-organization)

When testing authentication flows, you'll be redirected to the [IdP Simulator](/manual/fundamentals/test-sso-integration) to complete the process.

## Default Domains

Test organizations use default domains like `example.com` or `example.org`. These domains function similarly to how your real customers' domains work in production.

### How Domains Work with Organizations

For example:
- If Megasoft Inc is your customer with domain `megasoft.com` and uses Okta as their IdP
- When a user with email `john@megasoft.com` attempts to authenticate
- Scalekit identifies they belong to the Megasoft Inc organization based on their email domain
- The user is redirected to Megasoft's Okta instance to complete authentication

Similarly, in your test environment, users with `example.com` or `example.org` email addresses will be directed to the [IdP Simulator](/manual/fundamentals/test-sso-integration) for authentication.
