## What is SCIM provisioning?

Scaling organizations utilize a growing array of applications to support their employees' productivity. To efficiently and securely manage access to these applications, organization administrators employ Directory providers. These providers automate crucial workflows, such as granting access to new employees or revoking access for departing staff.

Directory providers, like Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory), serve as the authoritative source for user information and access rights. Organizations expect your application to accommodate their directory provider requirements. Consequently, you must design systems capable of interfacing with various directory providers used by their customers.

System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is an [Open Standard API specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-2) designed to manage identities across cloud applications easily and scalably. The specification suite builds upon experience with existing schemas and deployments, emphasizing:

- Simplicity of development and integration
- Application of existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models

Its intent is to reduce the cost and complexity of user management operations by providing:

- A common user schema
- An extension model; e.g., Enterprise User
- Binding documents to provide patterns for exchanging this schema using HTTP

## Why implement SCIM provisioning?

Implementing SCIM provisioning in your B2B application offers significant benefits for both your organization and your customers:

### For organizations

- **Reduced administrative overhead**: Automates user lifecycle management, eliminating manual user creation, updates, and deletions
- **Enhanced security**: Ensures prompt revocation of user access when employees leave an organization
- **IT workload reduction**: Eliminates the need for IT administrators to manually manage user accounts across multiple systems
- **Compliance support**: Helps meet various compliance requirements related to user access and data protection
- **Scalability**: Handles increased user numbers as organizations grow without requiring additional manual effort

### For end users

- **Improved onboarding experience**: New employees gain immediate access to necessary applications
- **Consistent information**: Ensures user information consistency across systems
- **Customization capabilities**: Allows for mapping of custom attributes via SCIM, enabling sync of specialized user data

Implementing support for SCIM allows you to offer a more attractive, enterprise-grade solution that meets the needs of growing organizations.

## Understanding the SCIM protocol

SCIM is an HTTP-based protocol that uses structured [JSON](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7159) payloads to exchange resource information between the SCIM client and service provider. The `application/scim+json` media type identifies SCIM protocol resources.

### Key components of SCIM

#### SCIM Service Provider

A SCIM Service Provider is any business application that provisions users and groups by synchronizing changes made in a SCIM Client, including creates, updates, and deletes. The synchronization enables end users to have seamless access to business applications with up-to-date profiles and permissions.

#### SCIM Client

A SCIM Client facilitates provisioning or managing user lifecycle events through SCIM endpoints exposed by the Service Provider. Identity Providers and HRMS systems act as SCIM Clients because they're treated as the source of truth for user identity data.

Popular SCIM Clients include:
- [Okta](https://www.okta.com)
- [Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id)

#### SCIM Endpoints and Methods

SCIM endpoints are the entry points to the SCIM API that clients call to provision users and groups:

**Common endpoints:**
- `/Users`
- `/Groups`

**SCIM methods (HTTP verbs):**
- GET - Retrieve resources
- POST - Create resources
- PUT - Replace resources
- PATCH - Update resources
- DELETE - Remove resources

#### SCIM Authentication

SCIM uses OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Authentication. The token authenticates SCIM API requests to the service provider and is passed in the HTTP Authorization header using the Bearer scheme.

### SCIM Resources and Schemas

SCIM Resources are the core building blocks of the protocol, representing entities such as users, groups, and organizational units. Each resource has attributes that describe the entity.

The SCIM User Resource includes basic attributes like email address, phone number, and name, but is extensible through additional schemas. For example, the Enterprise User extension adds attributes such as employee number, department, and manager.

Here's a simple example of a SCIM User Resource:

```json
{
    "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"],
    "userName": "bjensen",
    "name": {
        "givenName": "Barbara",
        "familyName": "Jensen"
    },
    "emails": [
        {
            "value": "bjensen@example.com",
            "type": "work",
            "primary": true
        }
    ],
    "entitlements": [
        {
            "value": "Employee",
            "type": "role"
        }
    ]
}
```

Common SCIM schemas include:
- [Core SCIM User Schema](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-4.1)
- [Enterprise User Schema](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-4.3)
- [Group Schema](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-4.2)

## How SCIM works in practice

Let's explore real-world scenarios that demonstrate how SCIM facilitates user provisioning from an Identity Provider to a SCIM Service Provider.

### Scenario 1: New Employee Onboarding

1. ACME Inc. hires a new employee, John Doe
2. ACME Inc. adds John Doe to their Okta Directory
3. Okta sends a SCIM `POST /Users` request to the SCIM Service Provider with John Doe's information
4. The Service Provider authenticates and validates the request
5. The Service Provider provisions John Doe as a new user in the application

### Scenario 2: Employee Termination

1. ACME Inc. terminates John Doe's employment
2. ACME Inc. removes John Doe from their Okta Directory
3. Okta sends a SCIM `DELETE /Users/john.doe` request to the SCIM Service Provider
4. The Service Provider authenticates and validates the request
5. The Service Provider deactivates John Doe's user account

### Scenario 3: Employee Transfer

1. ACME Inc. transfers John Doe to a different department
2. ACME Inc. updates John Doe's information in their Okta Directory
3. Okta sends a SCIM `PATCH /Users/john.doe` request to the SCIM Service Provider
4. The Service Provider authenticates and validates the request
5. The Service Provider updates John Doe's information in the application

### Example SCIM Request

Here's an example of a SCIM request to create a new user:

```http
POST /Users HTTP/1.1
Host: yourapp.scalekit.com/directory/dir_12442/scim/v2
Accept: application/scim+json
Content-Type: application/scim+json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SCIM_API_TOKEN

{
    "schemas":["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"],
    "userName":"bjensen",
    "externalId":"bjensen",
    "name":{
        "formatted":"Ms. Barbara J Jensen III",
        "familyName":"Jensen",
        "givenName":"Barbara"
    }
}
```

## Simplifying SCIM with Scalekit

Scalekit serves as an intermediary component in your B2B application architecture, providing a streamlined interface to access user information programmatically and in real-time.

### How Scalekit helps

With Scalekit, your application can:

1. Automatically determine user roles (e.g., admin, member)
2. Retrieve user access permissions
3. Tailor the user experience accordingly and securely

By integrating Scalekit, you can meet enterprise requirements without diverting focus from your core product development. This approach significantly reduces the engineering effort and time typically required to implement compatibility with various directory providers.

### Scalekit's SCIM implementation

Scalekit's SCIM implementation is built upon the principles of simplicity, security, and scalability. It provides a normalized implementation of the SCIM protocol across different Identity Providers and Directory Providers. This allows you to focus on integrating with Scalekit's API and leave the complexities of SCIM protocol implementation to us.

While not all Directory Providers implement SCIM or support all SCIM features, Scalekit abstracts these complexities to provide a seamless experience for provisioning users and groups.

### Real-time updates with webhooks

Scalekit supports webhooks to send real-time updates to your application about user provisioning and deprovisioning events when changes are detected in your customer's SCIM-compliant Directory Providers.

We normalize webhook payloads across different Directory Providers so you can focus on building your application without worrying about the nuances of each provider's implementation.

Refer to our [Webhooks documentation](/reference/webhooks/) to learn more about listening for directory changes and updating user roles in your application.
