**Organizations** in Scalekit represent your customers. You can create and manage organizations for your customers, and enable features for them. This guide will walk you through creating and managing organizations via the Scalekit Dashboard and the API.

## Via Scalekit dashboard

### Create an organization

1.  Navigate to the **Organizations** tab in the Scalekit Dashboard.
2.  Click on the **+ Create organization** button.

3.  Enter a name for the organization. This is typically the name of your customer company.
4.  You can also select the features you want to enable for this organization, such as SSO or Directory Sync.

5.  Click **Create** to create the organization.

### Onboard enterprise customers

For enterprise customers who need to configure their own Single Sign-On (SSO) or SCIM, you can generate an admin portal link. This link provides your customer with a sandboxed environment to configure their identity provider or directory provider without accessing your Scalekit dashboard.

After creating an organization and enabling features like SSO or Directory Sync, you can find the generated admin portal link on the organization's details page.

Share this link with your customer's IT admin to let them complete the configuration on their own.

## Via API

You can also manage organizations programmatically using the Scalekit API.

### Create an organization

Here's how to create an organization using the Node.js SDK:

<Tabs syncKey="tech-stack">
<TabItem label="Node.js" value="nodejs">
```javascript
const organization = await sc.organization.createOrganization(name, {
  externalId: 'externalId',
});
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Generate admin portal link

To enable features like SSO and Directory Sync for an organization and generate the admin portal link, you can update the organization's settings.

<Tabs syncKey="tech-stack">
<TabItem label="Node.js" value="nodejs">
```javascript
const settings = {
  features: [
    {
      name: 'sso',
      enabled: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'dir_sync',
      enabled: true,
    },
  ],
};

await sc.organization.updateOrganizationSettings('<organization_id>', settings);
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After this, the admin portal link will be available for the organization.
