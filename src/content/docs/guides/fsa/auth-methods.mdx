Integrate various authentication methods to allow users to sign into your application. Choose from the following options:

- **Passwordless**: Users sign in by verifying a one-time password (OTP) or a secure magic link, typically sent to their email or phone.
- **Social**: Users sign in using their existing accounts from popular social media platforms like Google or GitHub.
- **Enterprise SSO**: Users sign in using their organization's Single sign-on (SSO) credentials, connecting via their company's identity provider (IdP).

## Passwordless

Enable passwordless sign-in for your users. With this method, users verify their identity using a one-time password (OTP) or a secure magic link sent to their email or phone, eliminating the need for traditional passwords.

- Configure verification code expiration time

## Social

Implement social sign-in to let users conveniently access your application using their existing social media accounts with a single click.

## Enterprise SSO

Set up Enterprise SSO to allow users from your customers' organizations to securely access your application using their existing company credentials via their identity provider (IdP).

Key capabilities include:
- Support industry-standard protocols like SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect (OIDC) for identity federation, or allow customers to self-configure from a [list of compatible identity providers](/guides/integrations/sso-integrations/)
- Implement email domain-based routing to automatically direct users to their organization's appropriate Single sign-on (SSO) login page

Once configured, these authentication methods become available in your Scalekit-managed sign up and sign in pages. This provides a fully functional and cohesive authentication experience for your users.
