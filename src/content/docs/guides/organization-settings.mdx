This guide is a continuation of [Manage organizations](/guides/fsa/manage-organization/). It explains how to set up SSO or SCIM configurations for your customers directly from the Scalekit Dashboard, as an alternative to sending them an admin portal link.

## SSO configuration

Scalekit acts as a service provider on behalf of your application to your customer's identity provider.

From the organization's settings page in the dashboard, you can configure SSO.

The process involves:

1.  **Configure User Attributes:** Map attributes from the identity provider to user profiles in Scalekit.
2.  **Enter Identity Provider Configuration:** Input the metadata from your customer's IdP. This includes details like **Entity ID**, **ACS URL**, and **X.509 certificate**.
3.  **Assign Users and Groups:** Specify which users and groups can use this SSO connection.
4.  **Test SSO:** Perform a test login to ensure the connection works correctly.
5.  **Enable Connection:** Once tested, enable the SSO connection for the organization.

For detailed guides on configuring specific identity providers, refer to the admin guides under [SSO integrations](/guides/integrations/sso-integrations/).

## SCIM configuration

Scalekit can act as a SCIM provider on behalf of your application. This allows your customers to provision and manage users and groups in your application from their directory provider.

To set up SCIM:

1.  **SCIM Endpoint:** Provide this endpoint to your customer to configure in their directory provider.
2.  **Bearer Token:** Generate and provide this token to your customer. Note that this token is **rotatable** for security.
3.  **Assign Users and Groups:** After the connection is active, you can see which users and groups are being synced.

For detailed guides on configuring SCIM with specific providers, refer to the admin guides at [SCIM integrations](/guides/integrations/scim-integrations/).
