### Plug-n-play auth for B2B SaaS

Scalekit helps you quickly add enterprise authentication to your B2B SaaS app without engineering overhead. It provides plug-and-play auth solutions like SSO, SCIM, and Social Logins.

Built for B2B use cases, Scalekit natively supports multi-tenancy and organization management. You can test auth flows in sandbox environments, simulate SSO without real IdP accounts, and deploy instantly with prebuilt integrations for Okta, Entra ID, JumpCloud, Google SSO, and Azure ADâ€”no custom code required.

At the top of the sidebar, you can find links to different topics used in this documentation, such as "Documentation" and "Demo" that each have their own sidebar configuration, while the "Starlight Docs" topic is a direct link to the Starlight documentation.

:::caution
This plugin originates from [HiDeoo](https://github.com/HiDeoo) but is not affiliated with him. Nonetheless, huge thanks to him for his work on this plugin. We just changed the topic switcher component, the rest is the same. Make sure to check out [the original plugin](https://github.com/HiDeoo/starlight-sidebar-topics).

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

## Installation

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { PackageManagers } from "@hideoo/starlight-plugins-docs-components";

<Steps>

1. Starlight Sidebar Topics Dropdown is a Starlight [plugin](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/). Install it using your favorite package manager:

    <PackageManagers pkg="starlight-sidebar-topics-dropdown" />

2. Configure the plugin in your Starlight [configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#plugins) in the `astro.config.mjs` file by specifying an array of topics each with its own sidebar configuration.

    The following example shows how to configure two new topics named "Guides" and "Reference" linking to the `/guides/` and `/reference/` pages respectively with their own sidebar configuration:

    ```diff lang="js"
    // astro.config.mjs
    // @ts-check
    import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
    import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
    +import starlightSidebarTopicsDropdown from 'starlight-sidebar-topics-dropdown'

    export default defineConfig({
      integrations: [
        starlight({
    +      plugins: [
    +        starlightSidebarTopicsDropdown([
    +          {
    +            label: 'Guides',
    +            link: '/guides/',
    +            icon: 'open-book',
    +            items: ['guides/getting-started', 'guides/manual-setup'],
    +          },
    +          {
    +            label: 'Reference',
    +            link: '/reference/',
    +            icon: 'information',
    +            items: ['reference/api', 'reference/components'],
    +          },
    +        ]),
    +      ],
    -      sidebar: [
    -        {
    -          label: 'Guides',
    -          items: ['guides/getting-started', 'guides/manual-setup'],
    -        },
    -        {
    -          label: 'Reference',
    -          items: ['reference/api', 'reference/components'],
    -        },
    -      ],
          title: 'My Docs',
        }),
      ],
    })
    ```

3. [Start the development server](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/#start-the-development-server) to preview the changes.

</Steps>

The Starlight Sidebar Topics Dropdown plugin behavior can be tweaked using various [topic configuration options](/docs/configuration/#topic-configuration).
