This guide walks you through configuring Single Sign-On (SSO) with Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) as your Identity Provider.

## What you'll learn

- How to set up a relying party trust in AD FS
- How to configure claims issuance policies
- How to establish the connection between AD FS and your application

## Before you begin

To successfully set up AD FS SAML integration, you'll need:

- Elevated access to your AD FS Management Console
- Access to the Admin Portal of the application you're integrating Microsoft AD FS with.

  Having these prerequisites ready before starting will make the configuration process smoother.

9. **Map User Attributes**
   - Enter a descriptive rule name (e.g., "ExampleApp via Scalekit")
   - Configure the following attribute mappings:
     - `E-Mail-Addresses` → E-Mail Address

10. **Complete Admin Portal Configuration**
    - Navigate to Identity Provider Configuration in the Scalekit Admin Portal
    - Select "Configure Manually"
    - The above endpoints are AD FS endpoints. You can find them listed in AD FS Console > Service > Endpoints > Tokens and Metadata sections. Enter these required details:
      - Microsoft AD FS Identifier: `http://<your-adfs-server-domain>/adfs/services/trust`
      - Login URL: `http://<your-adfs-server-domain>/adfs/ls`
      - Certificate:
        1. Access `https://<your-adfs-server-domain>/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml`
        2. Locate the text after the first `X509Certificate` tag
        3. Copy and paste this certificate into the "Certificate" field
    - Click "Update" to save the configuration

11. **Test the Integration**
    - In the Scalekit Admin Portal, click "Test Connection"
    - You will be redirected to the AD FS login page
    - Enter your AD FS credentials
    - Verify successful redirection back to the Admin Portal with the correct user attributes

</Steps>

## Verification

After completing the configuration, test the SSO integration by:

1. Logging out of your application
2. Attempting to log in using the SSO option
3. Verifying you're redirected to AD FS and can authenticate successfully

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your AD FS integration:

- Verify all claim mappings are correctly configured
- Check that the Metadata URL is accessible from Scalekit
- Ensure your AD FS server's clock is synchronized
- Review AD FS event logs for any authentication errors

  For additional assistance, contact Scalekit support with your AD FS configuration details and any error messages you're receiving.
