Use any HTTP client to make requests to Scalekit API endpoints and integrate authentication services into your applications. Make sure you set up your [Scalekit account](/docs/guides/extended/setup-scalekit) and obtain your API credentials[^1].

## API Requirements

- **Content Type**: All requests must include a `Content-Type: application/json` header
- **Request Format**: Request bodies must contain valid JSON
- **Security**: The API is served over HTTPS with TLS v1.2+ to ensure data security
- **Error Handling**: For troubleshooting issues, refer to the [Error reference](/reference/errors)

## Where to Send API Requests

Scalekit provides two separate environments for development and production use:

```
https://{environment}.scalekit.dev  (Development)
https://{environment}.scalekit.com  (Production)
```

Â¸ Items created in one environment cannot be transferred to another environment. The Sandbox environment is ideal for testing your integration before moving to Production.

## How to Authenticate with the API

Scalekit uses OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow for secure API authentication. This section explains how to obtain and use access tokens.

### Step 1: Request an Access Token

Make a POST request to our token endpoint with your credentials:

```sh
# Replace {ENV_URL} with your environment URL
# Replace {client_id} and {client_secret} with your actual credentials
curl https://{ENV_URL}/oauth/token \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'client_id={client_id}' \
  -d 'client_secret={client_secret}' \
  -d 'grant_type=client_credentials'
```

### Step 2: Receive Your Access Token

If your credentials are valid, you'll receive a JSON response containing:

```json
{
  "access_token": "DCRD10-e7c5c8139165228a82e442445fe01c16",  // Your token to use in all API requests
  "token_type": "bearer",                                      // The type of token issued
  "expires_in": 1799                                           // Token validity in seconds (30 minutes)
}
```

### Step 3: Use the Access Token in API Requests

Include your access token in the Authorization header for all API requests:

```sh
# Replace {ENV_URL} with your environment URL
# Replace {access_token} with the token received in step 2
curl --request GET "https://{ENV_URL}/api/v1/organizations" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}"
```

## Common Error Scenarios

When using the API, you might encounter these common errors:

- **401 Unauthorized**: Your access token is invalid or expired. Request a new token.
- **400 Bad Request**: Your request format is incorrect. Check your JSON payload.
- **403 Forbidden**: Your account doesn't have permission for the requested action.
- **429 Too Many Requests**: You've exceeded the rate limit. Slow down your requests.

For a complete list of errors and their solutions, see the [Error reference](/reference/errors).


 Our SDKs handle API authentication, token refresh, and error management automatically. This makes integration simpler and reduces development time. For more information, see the [SDKs](/docs/sdks) section.
