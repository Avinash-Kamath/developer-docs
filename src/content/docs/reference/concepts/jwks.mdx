A JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) is a collection of public keys used to verify JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Think of it as a secure public directory that helps verify if a JWT was actually issued by your authorization server.

The JWKS endpoint is a public HTTPS URL (usually at `/.well-known/jwks.json` or `/keys`) that provides these public keys. This lets your applications verify JWT signatures without storing the keys locally.


## How to Use the JWKS Endpoint

Your authorization environment provides a JWKS endpoint to verify JWT authenticity. This is particularly important for machine-to-machine (M2M) authentication:

1. Machine clients receive access tokens
2. When these machines make API requests
3. Your API can verify the token's authenticity using the JWKS endpoint

Here's how to access your JWKS endpoint:

```sh title="Get your JWKS"
curl -L 'https://<your-environment-domain>.scalekit.dev/keys'
```

The response looks like this:

```json title="JWKS Response" "kid"
{
    "keys": [
        {
            "use": "sig",
            "kty": "RSA",
            "kid": "snk_58327480432122566",
            "alg": "RS256",
            "n": "wUaqIj3pIE_zfGN9u4GySZs862..",
            "e": "AQAB"
        }
    ]
}
```
Each key in the JWKS contains the following components:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Key type (kty) | The cryptographic algorithm family used with the key |
| Signature algorithm (alg) | The specific algorithm used for signing |
| Key identifier (kid) | A unique identifier for the key |
| Key usage (use) | The intended use of the key |
| Algorithm-specific parameters | Additional parameters required by the algorithm |

## Example usage

Since it's a standard format, a lot of libraries can help you verify JWTs using the JWKS endpoint. This allows you to verify JWTs without having to store the keys locally.

Here's an example using the `express-jwt` library:

```js
const { expressjwt: jwt } = require("express-jwt");
const jwks = require('jwks-rsa');

const verifyJWT = jwt({
    secret: jwks.expressJwtSecret({
        cache: true,
        rateLimit: true,
        jwksUri: 'https://<your-environment-domain>.scalekit.dev/keys'
    }),
    algorithms: ['RS256'],
    issuer: 'https://<your-environment-domain>.scalekit.dev',
    audience: 'analytics-api'
});
```

## Key rotation

Scalekit automatically rotates keys periodically to maintain security. When keys are rotated:

1. New keys are added to the JWKS endpoint
2. Both old and new keys are available during a transition period
3. Old keys are eventually removed after the transition period

Your application should:
- Fetch the JWKS endpoint dynamically rather than hardcoding keys
- Implement caching with reasonable TTL to avoid excessive requests
- Handle multiple keys in the JWKS response

## Best practices

When working with JWKS:

- Always validate tokens against the JWKS endpoint
- Implement proper caching to reduce load on your authentication system
- Set up monitoring for JWT validation failures which could indicate key rotation issues
- Use libraries that handle key rotation automatically when possible
