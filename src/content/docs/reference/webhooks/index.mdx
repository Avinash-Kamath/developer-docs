## Common use cases

## Security

When implementing webhooks, it's crucial to verify that requests are coming from Scalekit. Our SDKs provide methods to verify webhook signatures See our [implementation guide](/guides/extended/webhook-best-practices/) to implement [webhook verification](/guides/extended/webhook-best-practices/#1-verify-webhook-signatures) in your application.
