Organization and User Objects are first-class citizens in Scalekit.

- A Organization is a tenant of your application and represents a business customer. They pay for your service and own data and resources in their tenant.
- A User is typically a member of one or more organizations and represents an individual user of your application.

 A User can be a member of one or more organizations, and conversely, an Organization can have one or more users.

- Scalekit uses email addresses as the primary unique identifier for a User within an Organization.
- The relationship between Organizations and Users is defined by memberships.
